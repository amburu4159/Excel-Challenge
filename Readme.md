# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
THe overview of the project is to anaylyze the relationships between successful, failed and canceled plays based on specified goal and launch date.

### Purpose
The purpose is to review the results of the "plays" against the set goals

## Analysis and Challenges
The main challenge i experienced was (objective 5) Use the SUM() function to populate the "Total Projects" column with the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row.
I was overthinking it and tried to create a formula that was looking at the kickstarter sheet and summing different categories. I spent a good amount of time and finally went to sleep. When i resumed the problem, it was clear as day that i needed to do a basic sum of three columns. 
I just needed to step away and tackle the problem with a fresher mind

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Didn't find much corelation on outcomes based on launch date
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The higher the Goals, the less "Number of Successful" there were. So there is a higher percentage of failure when the goals are higher

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Hard to do a proper analysis while using more than one criteria. For example, when i put a filter on "plays", i couldn't filter further on "outcomes" because you can only use one filter at a time

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could use Pie charts or bar graphs for this sample data
